This repository contains the code for conducting the analysis in the above
manuscript. 

Level 1_ code corresponds to data acquisition and cleaning steps.
Level 2_ code corresponds to merging and modelling steps.
Level 3_ code corresponds to presentation steps.

A note about data:
Traffic data are not included in the raw data folder because of the prohibitively large
size of the dataset. Similarly, processed data, model outputs, figures and tables are also not included 
because most files were too large for GitHub's size limit.
